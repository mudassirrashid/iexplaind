  <h2>How people use search?</h2>
<p>Many users rely on search engines, especially Google, to find what they are looking for. When making a particular search, they follow a general procedure that begins with the need to know about an information or service and ends with a click on the result. The ultimate goal is to get the user to complete the last step, but it's also important to understand human behavior on the search page. This knowledge will help users understand what to look for and how to find it, and to properly tune the <a href="http://www.iexplaind.com/search-engine-optimization-seo">SEO</a> process.
</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="border border-secondary"><img src="https://www.iexplaind.com/seo/img/search-engine-google-app.jpg" class="rounded" alt="3 SEO Tips"></span></p>

<h2>Search for Information</h2>
<p>You can go to various places such as search engines, yellow pages, newspapers, etc. to search for information. According to statistics, many people go to search engines to look for information, compared to other methods. This fact shows that it is becoming more important to optimize your website by targeting search engines. In fact, many companies are starting to look at search engines to improve website traffic and rank.</p>

<h2>Using the Most Common Search Engines</h2>
<p>Search engines use a variety of methods and algorithms to index web content and display it on search results pages. This is one of the reasons why users prefer a particular search engine. According to <abbr title="Comscore is an American media measurement and analytics company providing marketing data and analytics to enterprises; media and advertising agencies; and publishers."><a href="https://www.comscore.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ComScore</a></abbr>, Google has the top search engine market share of over 65% in 2011, and Yahoo is second with about 15%.</p>

<h2>Begin Your Search</h2>
<p>Users typically follow common steps when searching for information on the Web. The SEO process begins when a user needs to search for specific information. For example, users can search for local services and businesses. When you search with a search engine, you usually specify a specific search query or some keywords. Search engines provide the results you can choose to retrieve relevant content.</p>

<h2>Top search engines</h2>
<p>When you do a search, you need to send the request or search query as a group of words or keywords called a search string. Search engines use these keywords to determine the results that best match your query and display them on SERP. The SEO process focuses on commonly used keywords when creating on-page and off-page optimization plans.</p>
<p>Following are the most commonly used search engines that people prefer now a days.</p>
<h3>Google the most popular search engine</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="border border-secondary"><img src="https://www.iexplaind.com/seo/img/google-search.jpg" class="rounded" alt="Google Search"></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Google</a> holds the number one spot in search engines on the web, a staggering 89.43% difference from second-ranked Bing. According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/216573/worldwide-market-share-of-search-engines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">statista</a> and <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">statcounter</a>, Google dominates the market in every country on every device (desktop, mobile, tablet). What made Google the most popular and reliable search engine was the quality of search results. Google uses advanced algorithms to provide users with the most accurate results. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin came up with the idea that websites referred by other websites are more important than websites which are never referred by other websites and therefore deserve to be ranked high in search results.</p>
<p>Over the years, Google's ranking algorithms have been enhanced with hundreds of other factors, including the help of machine learning, and are still the most reliable way to find exactly what you're looking for on the Internet.</p>
<h3>Microsoft Bing</h3>
<p>The best search engine to replace Google is <a href="https://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Bing</a>. Bing's search engine share ranges from 2.83% to 12.31%. Bing is Microsoft's attempt to challenge Google in search, but despite its efforts, it has failed to convince users that its search engine is as reliable as Google.</p>
<p>Even though Bing is the default search engine for Windows PCs, their search engine market share remains low at all times. Bing is derived from Microsoft's previous search engines (MSN Search, Windows Live Search, Live Search) and is ranked 30th most visited website on the Internet by Alexa rank.</p>
<h3>Yahoo</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="border border-secondary"><img src="https://www.iexplaind.com/seo/img/yahoo-search.jpg" class="rounded" alt="Yahoo Search"></span></p>

<p><a href="https://www.yahoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Yahoo</a> is one of the most popular email providers, and its web search engine ranks third in search, with an average market share of 1%. From October 2011 to October 2015, Yahoo searches used Bing. In October 2015, Yahoo made an agreement with Google to provide search-related services, and until October 2018, Yahoo's search results were provided by both Google and Bing.</p>
<p>As of October 2019, Yahoo! Search is once again exclusively offered by Bing. Yahoo is also the default search engine for the Firefox browser in the United States (since 2014). Yahoo's web portal is extremely popular and ranks 11th among the most visited websites on the Internet (reference: Alexa).</p>
<h3>Duck - DuckDuckGo</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="border border-secondary"><img src="https://www.iexplaind.com/seo/img/duckduckgo.jpg" class="rounded" alt="DuckDuckGo"></span></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DuckDuckGo</a> traffic statistics, they serve an average of 47 million searches per day, yet their overall market share is consistently below 0.5%. Unlike most people believe, DuckDuckGo doesn't have its own search index (such as Google or Bing), but it uses a variety of sources to generate search results.</p>
<p>In other words, they don't have their own data, but rely on other sources (Yelp, Bing, Yahoo, StackOverflow, etc.) to provide answers to user questions. This is a big limitation compared to Google, which has a set of algorithms that determine the best results from all the websites available on the Internet. On the positive side, DuckDuckGo's interface is clean, it doesn't track users, and it's completely loaded with ads.</p>
<h3>Dogpile</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.dogpile.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dogpile</a> is a meta-search engine for information on the World Wide Web, with results from Google, Yahoo !, Yandex, Bing, and other popular search engines, including search engines from audio and video content providers such as Yahoo !</p>
<p>Dogpile went live in November 1996. This site was created and developed by Aaron Flin. Aaron Flin was dissatisfied with the various results of existing indexes and tried to query multiple indexes with Dogpile to get the best search results. Originally it provided web search from Yahoo !. (Directory), Lycos, Excite, WebCrawler, Infoseek, AltaVista, HotBot, WhatUseek, and World Wide Web Worm. It naturally elicited a comparison with the previously existing multithreaded search engine MetaCrawler, but Dogpile is more sophisticated, Usenet (from sources including DejaNews) and FTP (via Filez and other indexes). I was also able to search for. In August 1999, Dogpile was acquired by Go2net, which already operated MetaCrawler. Go2net was subsequently acquired by InfoSpace in July 2000 for $ 4 billion. Dogpile was first redesigned in December 2000.</p>
<p>Dogpile Search Engine won the J.D. Power and Associates Best Residential Online Search Engine Service Award in both 2006 and 2007. In August 2008, Dogpile and Petfinder signed a search partnership. In November 2008, Dogpile launched a "Search and Rescue" program to donate money to animal-related charities. This program also helps people find help with animals in need. By early December 2008, people using the Dogpile search engine had raised $ 100,000 for Dogpile's Search and Rescue program. In July 2016, Blucora announced that it would sell its InfoSpace business to OpenMail for $ 45 million in cash and put Dogpile under OpenMail's ownership. OpenMail was later renamed to System1.</p>
